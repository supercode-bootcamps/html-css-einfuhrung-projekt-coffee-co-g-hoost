                <h3><img src="assets/img/paper.png" alt="Eine Tasse Kaffee">OUR STORY</h3>
                <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give up my 9
                    to
                    5
                    job in the city. With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business was
                    NOT
                    to
                    look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the customers were guests in my
                    home.
                </p>
                <p>After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the art of the
                    business
                    but
                    have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I
                    serve
                    to my
                    family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served immediately to our guests.</p>
